<h1 style="text-align: center;">JAG PROJECT</h1>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Mail Config Form</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">The program will check if the MailConfig.properties file exists. If it does, then the Email Application opens right away, if not then we present the form to be filled</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The <strong>Save </strong>button saves and writes the changes to the MailConfig.properties and the <strong>Clear </strong>button simply erases the text fields on the form. If a connection can be made to the database when clicking on <strong>Save</strong>, the main application opens.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Menu Bar</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">The menu item <strong>Close </strong>performs a Platform.exit() and closes the application. The <strong>Add Attachment</strong> Menu item opens up the File Explorer and allows users to add regular attachments to the email being created/edited. The <strong>Save Attachment</strong> Menu Item takes the currently selected table row's email attachments and saves it to the project's root folder (same folder as the pom.xml). Every email's attachments that are sent or received are written to disk into the root folder and stored in the database. The <strong>About</strong> Menu Item brings you to this current page. The <strong>Return to configuration</strong> Menu item allows the user to modify the config form and save it once again.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Folder Creation/Deletion</strong></h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">The text field above the two buttons allow the user to input the name of the folder to be created. Users cannot create a folder with the same name as an existing folder. The <strong>Delete</strong> button will only work if the user clicks on a folder beforehand and will make a pop up if nothing is selected to be deleted. The emails of a corresponding folder are displayed in the table whenever a folder is clicked. Whenever the Inbox folder is clicked, the application updates the database with possible received Emails which may have come in.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Drag and Drop</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Users are allowed to drag an email in the table and drop it into any folder except the Draft folder. An alert pop up message is shown if the user tries to drag and drop to/from the Draft folder.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Show Email Details</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">Whenever an email in the table is clicked, its content along with its attachments are shown in the Form and html editor sections.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Button Functionality</h3>
<p style="text-align: center;">The <strong>Send</strong> button can send both regular email compositions of draft emails. If a user tries to send an email without any recipients or to a recipient with an invalid format, an error pop up appears with an appropriate message. Email recipients in the TO,CC,BCC can be seperated by semi-colon. ex: recipient1@gmail.com;recipient2@gmail.com</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The <strong>Save Draft </strong>will either update a current draft email if it was clicked on the table or create a completely new draft if no table row was clicked.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The <strong>Delete Emai</strong>l button will work on any selected table row that is selected. If nothing is selected, then a pop up error message is shown.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The <strong>Reply </strong>button takes a selected table row's Sender and subject prefixed with "RE:" and changes are made to the Form.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The <strong>Compose</strong> button enables the form and editor and clears everything so the user can compose a new email.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">The form and html editor are cleared whenever an email is sent/drafted or updated.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">Changing folder selections will also clear the form and html editor. Attachments that are added to the email must be inside of the root of the project (same folder as the pom.xml). Emails received that contain attachments are automatically added to the root folder even if it does not exist in the local machine yet.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><span style="color: #ff0000;">It is important noting that all incoming and outgoing attachments are saved to the root folder and database regardless of if they are embedded or not.</span></p>
